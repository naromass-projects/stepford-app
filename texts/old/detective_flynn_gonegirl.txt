My heart jumps so high, my uvula begins pulsing. My husband has fucked himself again.
The video loads, and there is Nick. He has the sleepy eyes he gets when he's drunk. The heavy lids, and he's got his sideways grin, and he's talking about me, and he looks like a human being. He looks happy. 'My wife, she just happens to be the coolest girl I've ever met', he says. 'How many guys can say that? I married the coolest girl I ever met.'
My stomach flutters delicately. I was not expecting this. I almost smile. 
'What's so cool about her?' the girl asks off-screen. Her voice is high, sorority-cheery.

And pretty, freckled Andie sat a few feet in front of me, wide-set blue eyes under chocolatey waves of hair, cushiony lips parted just a bit, ridiculously large, real breasts, and long thin legs and arms – an alien fuck-doll of a girl, it must be said, as different from my elegant, patrician wife as could be – and Andie was radiating body heat and lavender, clicking notes on her laptop, asking questions in a husky voice like ‘How do you get a source to trust you, to open up to you?’ And I thought to myself, right then: Where the fuck did this girl come from? Is this a joke?

I glance prettily toward the band onstage, where a skeletal septuagenarian is singing about love. Not far from our table, a straight-backed guy with a trim mustache tosses his cup toward a trash can near us and bricks (a term I learned from Nick). I wish I’d picked a more picturesque spot. And now the guy is looking at me, tilting his head toward the side, in exaggerated confusion. If he were a cartoon, he’d scratch his head, and it would make a rubbery wiik-wiik sound. For some reason, I think: He looks like a cop. I turn my back to him.
