It's true; one always seems to be waiting for something. "You seem to have thought it through," he says. You don't have to spell out to her, keep this to yourself, because she knows to do that; you don't have to lead this female child through a conversation with the little shifts and demurs that most women demand.

Once Winchester has gone, Anne hangs over the king again; her eyes flick sideways, as if she were drawing him into conspiracy. Anne's bodice is still tight-laced, only a slight fullness of her breasts indicating her condition. There has been no announcement; announcements are never made, women's bodies are uncertain things and mistakes can occur.

"So forgive her," he says. "Write her a pardon. Put these people under a debt of gratitude to you, if you want them to leave off their foolish sentiment toward Katherine."
