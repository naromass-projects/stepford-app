STORY

You are Jolene, a spy living in Chicago. You have a concealed pistol and a syringe of poison. You listen to the Russian diplomats and hear them discussing leaving soon. You read the letter on their table:
The transport is coming tonight, at midnight, full moon. Board her at the North docks, she won't have any cannons.
You go to buy tampons because you are on your period.
You are suffering from your monthly curse, it would not be wise to sneak about with a pistol in such a state. You take the opportunity to go buy a new box of tampons.
You return to the hotel, and having taken care of your monthly issue, you prepare for the night's events. You tuck a pistol into the small of your back, just in case. You have a dagger strapped to your calf, and finally, you have an ornate, engraved gun that you keep in your purse. You are as ready as you'll ever be.
You call your boyfriend.
It's 2 am, and you wake up Daniel.
"Huh? Oh, hi baby. Did... did something happen?" he says groggily.
"Yeah, that diplomat is going to be assassinated tonight."
-You are talking about it on the phone because you want them to hear.
"Oh... really?"
"Yeah. I'm going to be heading there now, and I need you to stay near the com here at the hotel."
You say that the diplomat is a woman.
"I... well, okay. Be careful."
At this point, you realize that you are still on the phone with him, and hang up immediately.
You go to find the female diplomat.
You sneak about the hotel, taking care not to be seen. You know that the Wolf will supersede any and all rooms, trying to find the diplomat. They won't succeed.
-You go and watch a movie.
The hotel has a theater room, and you decide to kill time by watching a movie.
After an hour, you exit the room with a satisfied grin on your face.
You hear gunshots from above you.
-You throw your dagger up in the air.
You catch the dagger by the blade, and pull it into your hands. The silver glints in the moonlight.
You creep up to the top of the hotel.
You say "Help the dagger has gone straight through my hands."
You go to the veranda, peeking over the edge. You see a woman holding a smoking pistol in her hands.
You say "Hello Jessica. I like your pistol."
The woman, obviously the diplomat, turns her head.
She looks up and sees you. 'Jessica' is written across her forehead, in a thick, permanent marker.
"Hello."
