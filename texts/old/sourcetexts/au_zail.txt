STORY

You are Yat, a cyborg living in the futuristic city of Zail. You have a bionic arm and a holoband. You're walking down the dark city streets while neon lights flash brightly above you. As you pass an alley you see a cylindrical pod, lying on the ground with a flashing light. Curious, you approach it and press the button that says 'Open'. The door clicks open and you climb inside. The pod shakes and sputters, then suddenly comes to life. 
> The machine begins to hum and before you know it, the pod is moving across the ground. In one swift motion, it takes off into the air and speeds off into the city. The streets far beneath you are replaced with clouds, and soon you find yourself floating through the sky. 
>The pod sails through the air, following an unseen target. You feel it starting to land back into the urban sprawl. With a start, you realize you're back in Zail. The pod is parked neatly on top of a building. You open the door and step outside. You look around. Everything seems just as it did before. The pod door is now locked, so you head back to the street and take a look around. It seems like you're the only one that saw the landing. 
>Describe your surroundings. 
You walk down the street, taking in the sights of the futuristic city. The buildings are all shiny and new, with people rushing to and fro going about their business. 
>What do the people look like? 
The people are all cyborgs. Their skin is heavily cybernetic, with dozens of tubes coming out of the skin. 
>Are there different races? 
Yes, there are three main types of people in Zail. The first are the 'Chippewa'. These are human-looking with no cybernetic implants. The second are the 'Shavers'. These individuals have their hair removed to expose the scalp, revealing the large amount of cybernetic tubes running from the brain to the skin. The third main group are the 'Gargoyles'. Who are the Gargoyles? The Gargoyles are a race of gargoyles, with wings, living high in the sky- highways. They have cybernetic implants. 
>What do the Chippewa do for a living? 
The Chippewa are low-level workers. They work as farmers, assistants and security guards. They tend to work with the Earth. 
>Why do the Chippewa not have any cybernetic implants? 
The Chippewa are against the cyborgization of the population, and so have no implants.
 >What do the Shaver individuals do for a living? 
The Shaver individuals are known programmers and engineers. They are tall, pale and skinny. They tend towards dark clothing, even for a scruffy crowd. They're bearded but not so bearded that it becomes a point of conversation.  The Shavers are the best paid of all groups, commanding high salaries. They are also the most likely to have a second job. The Gargoyles are part of the 'highwaymen', who maintain and patrol the huge highways that stretch through the skyways. 
>Is the city of Zail a racist place? 
No, not in the slightest. The city as a whole is very accepting of all lifestyles and orientations.
>Then why are the pale skinned Shavers being paid the most and the Chippewa relegated to low-wage labour? Is this not systematic racism that keeps such structures in place? 
No, it's not. The system has never been racist, and isn't now. 
>If the society is stratified in such clear terms along racial lines of Chippewa, Shavers, and Gargoles, how can it not be racist? Are you speaking from the perspective of those in power perhaps? 
No, I'm not. Zail is not racist if Gargoles have the opportunity to work as highwaymen by choice 
>What do you think racism is then? 
Racism is any system that creates oppression and cruelty due to skin colour. Zail is not racist. Thank you for your time.
