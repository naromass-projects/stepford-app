STORY


Scenario: [Whatever fit the prompt from the poem Aubade by Phillip Larkin]
Slowly light strengthens, and the room takes shape.
It stands plain as a wardrobe, what we know,
Have always known, know that we can’t escape,
Yet can’t accept. One side will have to go.
Meanwhile telephones crouch, getting ready to ring
In locked-up offices, and all the uncaring
Intricate rented world begins to
Move, the subway trains like beasts
Stirring in their beds, the street-cars grumble
While slowly the sky fills with commerce and bustle
And the thunder of business. I dress to face it
In the unavailing pretence that everything’s the same.
I don’t fear, I don’t tremble: just now I’m stiff
With what’s coming, as if it were a strapping stranger
I met in the corridor. It won’t be long now
Before I shall know a few more things than I
Know now: how will it feel? Is death a thing like sleep?
Just now it seems impossible that I shall sleep
And never wake again. Is this the way you feel
Just before the anaesthetic that nothing can hurt you
And nothing can happen? There’s a draft from the
Window, it makes my eyes water—that’s how it feels.
There’s a small glass of brandy on the dressing table;
I’ve never been much good at drinking. Just a
Sip, to wet my whistle and help the morning
Digestion—nothing like it for chasing fears away.
A straw-colored fluid, a little worn
At the edges of the glass, tiny yellow men
Carousing on their individual straws.
