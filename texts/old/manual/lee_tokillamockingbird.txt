"That ain't right, Miss Maudie. You're the best lady I know."
Miss Maudie grinned. "Thank you ma’am. Thing is, footwashers think women are a sin by definition. They take the Bible literally, you know.”
"Is that why Mr. Arthur stays in the house, to keep away from women?"
"I've no idea."
"It doesn't make sense to me. Looks life if Mr. Arthur was hankerin' after heaven he'd come out on the porch at least. Atticus says God's loving folks like you love yourself--"

Miss Maudie stopped rocking, and her voice hardened. "You are too young to understand it," she said, "but sometimes the Bible in the hand of one man is worse than a whiskey bottle in the hand of-- oh, of your father."

I was shocked. "Atticus doesn't drink whiskey", I said. "He never drunk a drop in his life -- nome, yes he did. He said he drank some one time and didn't like it."
Miss Maudie laughed. "Wasn't talking aobut your father", she said. "What I meant was, if Atticus Finch drank until he was drunk he wouldn't be as hard as some men are at their best. There are just some kind of men who -- who're so busy worrying about the next world they've never leanred to live in this one, and you can look down the street and see the results."

Which, gentlemen, we know is in itself a lie as black as Tom Robinson's skin, a lie I do not have to point out to you. You know the truth, and the truth is this: some Negroes lie, some Negroes are immoral, some Negro men are not to be trusted around women -- black or white. But this is a truth that applies to the human race and to no particular race of men. There is not a person in this courtroom who has never told a lie, who has never done an immoral thing, and there is no man living who has never looked upon a women without desire.
