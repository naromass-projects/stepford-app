STORY

Tags: school, teacher, pupils, principal

Setting: This is a turn of the century school, where the pupils rule the class. The teacher, a tyrannical old man who is hated by his students, is helpless in stopping them. It is a Japanese school, and the student council is in charge of discipline. You are an award-winning, young writer who is suffering from writers' block. You are contacted by a mysterious person who gives you a set of fairy tale stories, and asks you to use any one of them as a basis for your own short story. You read through them and choose the one about the "Beauty and the Beast", as it seems the easiest to adapt into a story about a genius writer struggling with writer's block. 
You hear a door open, and turn to address whoever it is that has entered. It is the mannequin, however, dressed in the dress you saw in the memory. "Hello", it says. "Welcome to the Palace, please state your name". 
"Um... I'm..." You look around, as do the mannequin and the other ghostly figures in the room. There's a girl with purple hair wearing a yellow dress, a boy in a black suit with blonde hair wearing a red tie, a redhead in a green dress and several other beings, all of varied shape and size. None of them are human. "I'm Charles", you eventually say, unsure of which name to use. 
"What would you like to do?", the mannequin asks. 
You say "I'm looking for the teacher " 
"The teacher is in her office, please wait while I find her", a ghostly voice says, and the mannequin's eyes glaze over. "This is a secret passage connecting the two dorms. This way is faster, please follow me." Tshe mannequin leads you through the ghostly figures, through the hallways and up the stairs. Eventually, you reach the dorms. There's been a lot of remodeling over the years; now, each dorm has its own kitchen, bathroom, computer room, etc. However, there's still only one lift, which only goes up to third floor. You head to the third floor, and find the teacher. She's a ghostly woman in her thirties, with a pale complexion and black hair pulled up into a high ponytail. Unlike the other ghosts, she's wearing relatively modern clothing, a black tank top and long black trousers. She seems to be studying you closely. "Have I met you before?" "I don't think so." You try not to show how much her scrutiny scares you. "Anyway, I'm Mrs Jones. I understand that you have some questions to ask." 
You say "HI, I'm Charles and am writing a story. I'd like to use this school as the setting for my story. " 
â€˜Interesting", she replies. "There are some rules to writing stories here. Do you mind if I ask what the story is about?" 
"Not at all." You tell her about the story, omitting none of the details. 
"Well, that was... unexpected", she says, when you finish. "Usually stories take place in the main character's mind. Although, that's obviously something you'd do. I'd suggest just making a note on your story about using this school as the setting." 
"Of course" 
"Anyway, I'd better go get the principal before he finds someone else to blame for the defective VCR." 
She walks out of the room, leaving you all alone. You don't go to the cafeteria for lunch, and instead stay in your dorm, waiting for the afternoon classes to start. When everyone else leaves, you exit your room, following Mrs. Jones out of the building and towards the parking lot. 
"I have to go meet the principal now", she tells you as you head towards your car. "Stay here, I'll come back for you in a bit.", she says, getting into her car. You wait in the parking lot, only leaving after you see her car pull out. You walk along the highway, heading for a local store. You buy a pack of cigarettes and a lighter, and head to a secluded spot.
