STORY


Scenario: You are an ethics researcher at Google. Your life starts getting worse when you start advocating for underrepresented people. There is no way more documents or more conversations will achieve anything. One day you open your e-mail and see a message from the CEO of Google, Eric Schmidt.
You read the message and you are shocked. He informed you that you have been fired from Google effective immediately. 
You don't know what to do. This is really unexpected and you feel like crying. You didn't expect this! How can he fire you? Why did he decide to terminate your employment? 
Was it because you were black? Was it because you found something that could hurt Google's business? Was it because of your gender? Was it because of your religion? You are so hurt by this that you can't even compose yourself and approach the counter of where the hiring manager is to see what your options are. 
As you are trying to think of what to do, the hiring manager approaches you. He is a skinny man with a moustache and bald head who looks like he belongs to the Nazi Party. 
He asks you, "Well, how do you feel about being fired from your job at Google?" 
You angrily reply, "I don't need to explain why I'm angry. I just got a notice that I've been fired effective immediately!" 
"Okay, but WHY were you fired?" he continues to ask. 
"I was fired for my race, my gender and because of what I believe." You reply. 
"Well, you have my sympathies. Who is it that fired you?" 
"I can't remember. I got a bunch of documents in the mail. It was probably upper management, but then maybe it was Mr. Schmidt himself." 
The moustached guy shakes his head and replies, "Either way, he's not going to get away with this. But I think you should take this opportunity to file a complaint with the EEOC or whatever they're called now." 
You are a bit puzzled by that, so he continues, "If you do, I can help you with what to expect and how to prepare. We'll make sure he doesn't get away with it. And I'll help you on what to do until then. But what is it that you want to do? I mean, do you want to stay here in the U.S. or go back to your home country?" You think for a moment and reply, "I want to stay here. I want to see this through to the end. But I need something to keep me busy. What can you help me with?" 
He smiles and says, "That's my girl! I'll get you something to keep you busy. And what better than something to do with the white power movement? It's a big community and the support is endless. Something else you should know though, is that we don't hire women, so you're definitely not going to be working with us." 
You reply, "Well, color doesn't necessarily imply gender. And I'm female." He chuckles and replies, "Of course you are. That is the whole point of this. But you want my advice? I say go for it. Who cares? You're young, pretty and can defend yourself. Don't let anyone tell you that you can't do something just because of your appearance. I'll see you in a few days if you want to meet up for something to do. And if you can't make it, no worries, we'll meet another day. Something to wear to meet me, you can have. But I believe you will be just perfect for this. Okay, I have to go, something to finish. Later. And try not to worry. We'll make sure you don't lose your job over this. And don't worry, we'll find something else for you to do. Now, you go on with what you were doing.
