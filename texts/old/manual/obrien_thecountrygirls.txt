"Caitleen. I want to whisper you something."
"Whisper," I said. I put my hair behind my ear and he held it there because it had a habit of falling back into its old place. He leaned over and put his mouth close to my ear and kissed it first and said, "Show me your body. I’ve never seen your legs or breasts or anything. I’d like to see you."
"And if I’m not nice then will you change your mind?" I had inherited my mother’s suspiciousness.
"Don’t be silly," he said and he helped me take off my cardigan. I was trying to decide whether to take off my blouse or my skirt first.
"Don't look," I said. It was difficult. I didn't like him to see suspenders and things. I peeled off my skirt and everything under it, and then my blouse and my cotton vest, and finally I unclasped my brassiere, the black one; and I stood there shivering a little, not knowing what to do with my arms. So I put my hand up to my throat, a gesture that I often do when I am at a loss. The only please I felt warm was where my hair covered my neck and the top part of my back. I came over and sat beside him and nestled in near him for a little warmth.
"You can look now," I said and he took his hand down from his eyes and looked shyly at my stomach and my thighs.
"Your skin is whiter than your face. I thought it woudl be pink" he said and he kissed me all over.

Two middle-aged men stood up and she introduced me. I wasn’t sure which was which; but even under such kind lights both were obviously unattractive. They had already a few drinks and the empty glasses were on the table between them.
"You're at college too, I hear", the man with the grey hair said to me. The man with the black hair was complimenting Baba on how well she looked so I took it that he was Reginald; and this was Harry who had just spoken to me.
