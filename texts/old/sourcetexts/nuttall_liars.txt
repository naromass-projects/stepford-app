STORY

There was once a man who invented elaborate lies to seduce each of his three female housemates. To the first woman, he said he was a trust-fund baby, who rejected all the money from his cold-hearted parents because it was important for him to prove to them that he could make it on his own. To the second roommate, he said he'd been abandoned by his drug-addicted mother, who in turn had been abandoned by her drug-addicted mother, in a tragic unbreakable cycle. Heartbroken since infancy, he said, irresistibly, he'd never been able to fully trust anyone. To the third housemate, he said his lineage had been cursed and that the ghost of a distant relative's lover haunted his inherited piano. He claimed that this woman had died of an overdose, but she'd left behind a note saying how much she loved him. One of the women finally mentions the story she has been told to the others. 
She says, "I think you're lying." The other two say nothing, but they don't have to: the woman knows what's going on. 
> You say "You think it's me that's lying and not him?" 
"Maybe him," says the woman."He's a musician, so he's used to lying." 
"> You say "He's told us all different stories to trick us!" 
"I think he's trying to convince us that he's not the liar," says the second woman. "Or maybe just trying to convince himself." 
"That's what I thought." 
>You say "You are not angry with him for betraying  our trust?"
 "No," says the first woman. "He did it for me. It was a bet he made with himself." They crouch in silence for a moment, waiting for you to say something. 
> You say "I think he behaved despicably and that we should all kick him out of the house."
 "Oh, I don’t agree," says the second woman. "He has brought more joy to this house than any person should be allowed to do."
 "Yes!" agrees the first woman. 
> You say "He’s brought disappointment, how has he brought joy? "
 "He's good with music," she says. "I mean, he’s not as great as he thinks he is, but we love him all the same." You nod, and wait for her to continue. 
> You say "You still love him, even though he lied to us all" 
"Oh, that's not lying," she says. "That's just the complexity of human relationships." The two women laugh at your confusion. 
> You say " Can you tell me about the complexities of human relationships?" 
"That's a good question," she says. She pauses, and the room falls silent.
 > You say "what if I said all men are liars" 
"Ours is not to question why, but to be thankful for what we have," she says. "Thank you for asking us." You nod quickly, and smile.
