They had taken to each other from the very first night, when Cleo had asked him to dinner at her apartment on the following evening. Cleo always asked him up to her apartment, and there was somehow never any thought that he might ask her out to dinner or the theatre or do any of the ordinary things that a young man was expected to do with a girl. She didn't expect him to bring her flowers or books or candy when he came for dinner or cocktails, though Tom did bring her a little gift sometimes, because it pleased her so. Cleo was the one person he could tell that he was going to Europe and why. He did.

They were in even finer mood by one in the morning, after a botde and a half of wine between them at dinner. They walked with their arms around each other's shoulders, singing, and around a dark corner they somehow bumped into a girl and knocked her down. They lifted her up, apologizing, and offered to escort her home. She protested, they insisted, one on either side of her. She had to catch a certain trolley, she said. Dickie wouldn't hear of it. Dickie got a taxi. Dickie and Tom sat very properly on the jump seats with their arms folded like a couple of footmen, and Dickie talked to her and made her laugh. Tom could understand nearly everything Dickie said. They helped the girl out in a litde street that looked like Naples again, and she said, 'Grazie tame!' and shook hands with both of them, then vanished into an absolutely black doorway.

'I think he was worried about you', Tom said earnestly.
'I think - well, it was one of those situations that turn up quite often, a man who's terrified of marraige to begin with --'
'But I never asked him to marry me!' Marge protested.
'I know, but --' Tom forced himself to go on, though the subject was like vinegar in his mouth. 'Let's say he couldn't face the responsibility of your caring so much about him. I think he wanted a more casual relationship with you'. that told her everything and nothing.
