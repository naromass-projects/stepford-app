STORY

Prompt: https://davidwhyte.stores.yahoo.net/beandbl.html 

In a burning land, within sight of a hundred or more funeral pyres at any one time, he stands out in his white clothes with hands raised and palms together in prayer. He walks with a gait somewhere between a shuffle and a skip and is always flanked by two young Indian men. They wear white shirts and trousers. One carries a large umbrella to keep off the sun for him, the other carries a silver urn with a spout from which offerings of Ganges water are given to anyone who wants or needs a blessing.

At the end of each day the three men disappear into a white tent on the banks of the river to sleep.
This is the Aghori, the revered Hindu holy man.
I stand beside him as he offers a blessing and a woman with no hands reaches out to receive it. I am struck by the intimacy of the scene. His hands hover just over her head and then settle briefly on her forehead before returning to his lap. I can feel her gratitude toward him.
I watch him closely. In his eighty years he has perfected the art of compassion. It is clear that he sees no difference between himself and anyone else. He does not draw attention to himself yet the adoration of the people is for him and his alone.

He turns and looks at me over his shoulder. I feel as if I am being X-rayed.
He turns back again, bows and walks on.

A man with kohl-rimmed eyes and matted hair holds out a begging bowl. I put my hands in my pockets. It is true I have nothing to give him but I feel his expectation like an insult. I walk on, uncomfortable.
I glance over my shoulder and see the man's face change as he looks over the crowd that passes. He turns back to me and I see desperation there.
As I cut across the road toward the path back to the tent, hands like claws grab my shoulders and turn me around. Startled, I try to twist away but his grip is strong and I am trapped.
I see madness in his eyes and terror runs through me.
He looks at me with a mixture of pain and disgust before spitting full in my face and releasing me as the crowd surges between us.
I walk on, shaken, unsure what just happened.
